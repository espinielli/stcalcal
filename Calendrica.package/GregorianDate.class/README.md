I represent a point in time in the Gregorian calendar.
My instances are immutable.
Historically the date of adoption of the Gregorian Calendar is 15 Oct 1582
(it was timely implemented only by four Catholic counties in Europe).
The previous day was Julian 4 Oct 1582.
This implementation considers a continuous time line going indefinetly back in the past.
