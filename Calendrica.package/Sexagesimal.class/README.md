I am an abstract class which aims at factoring out the base-60 computations common to angle, time and coordinate entities.

sixtyZero is the coefficient of 60^0, i.e. the number seconds of arc or seconds of time.
sixtyOne  is the coefficient of 60^1, i.e. the number of minutes of arc or minutes of time.
sixtyTwo  is the coefficient of 60^2, i.e. the number of degrees of arc or hours of time.
